# GeneVault: Secure Genomic Data Exchange Protocol

A next-generation framework for privacy-protected genomic data sharing built on Stacks blockchain technology with Bitcoin's settlement layer security.

## Project Vision

GeneVault reimagines how genomic data can be securely shared between researchers and data providers by creating a trustless protocol that maintains individual privacy while accelerating scientific discovery. By leveraging Stacks' unique capabilities, GeneVault ensures:

- Complete ownership of personal genetic information remains with providers
- Researchers gain access to valuable datasets without compromising privacy
- Data providers receive fair compensation through transparent mechanisms
- All interactions benefit from Bitcoin's security and immutability

## Distinctive Features

### Segmented Data Structures
- Modular genetic data representation divided into non-identifying segments
- Granular sharing options at the segment level rather than full genome
- Metadata separation from core genetic information
- Composite query system for targeted research without full data exposure

### Multi-Party Computation Layer
- Secure computation on encrypted genetic data without decryption
- Distributed processing across nodes with partial information
- Aggregate result verification without raw data exposure
- Collaborative research capabilities with privacy guarantees

### Tiered Consent Framework
- Dynamic consent management through smart contracts
- Time-bound and purpose-specific access controls
- Context-aware permission hierarchies
- Automated consent expiration and renewal

### Verifiable Research Outcomes
- Publication and result verification tied to source data
- Citation tracking and attribution through smart contracts
- Impact-based compensation models for data providers
- Scientific milestone achievements recorded on-chain

### Decentralized Governance
- Stakeholder voting on protocol parameters
- Community-driven ethics guidelines
- Transparent policy evolution
- Specialized dispute resolution mechanisms for genetic data

## Technical Innovation

### Privacy Mechanisms
- Homomorphic encryption for in-place computation
- Multi-signature approval for sensitive data access
- Differential privacy guarantees for statistical analysis
- Zero-knowledge attestations for data veracity

### Stacks Integration Points
- Clarity smart contracts for consent management
- Bitcoin settlement layer for value exchange
- sBTC integration for cross-chain functionality
- Stacks 2.0 Proof-of-Transfer for consensus

### Data Architecture
- Sharded storage model across decentralized nodes
- Content-addressed cryptographic references
- Hierarchical deterministic key generation for access control
- Temporal access validation through Bitcoin block anchoring

### Research Tools
- Secure statistical analysis functions
- Privacy-preserving machine learning capabilities
- Federated computation across distributed datasets
- Verifiable computation proof system

## Core Smart Contracts

The protocol consists of four innovative Clarity smart contracts:

1. **genetic-segments.clar**: Manages the modular genomic data structure and segmentation
2. **consent-layers.clar**: Handles the tiered consent framework and access permissions
3. **compute-verification.clar**: Manages secure multi-party computation verification
4. **incentive-distribution.clar**: Controls the compensation framework and impact tracking
